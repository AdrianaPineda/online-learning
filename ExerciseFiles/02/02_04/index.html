    slow the performance of the site significantly

HTML parsing
JS downloading
JS executing

There are 3 ways JavaScript can load:
1. Right away
- HTML parsing until it finds a JavaScript reference, it downloads the JS, then executes and finally
it continues with tht HTML parsing.
2. Asynchronous <script src="script.js" async></script>
- The js file will be downloaded along side the html and render blocking will only occur when the js is
executing
3. Defer <script src="script.js" defer></script>
- JS execution only happens when everything else is loaded.
- HTML parsing and JS downloading happens at the same time
