JavaScript is a scripting language that runs in the browser, interacts with the html markup
and css rules that change what you see and what you can do.
Allows you to write small programs that run in the browser and change the html and css of
the current document

What is an scripting language:
"A scripting language is a programming language that employs a high-level construct to interpret and execute one command at a time."

"A scripting or script language is a programming language that supports scripts: programs written for a special run-time environment that automate the execution of tasks that could alternatively be executed one-by-one by a human operator. Scripting languages are often interpreted (rather than compiled)"

"Compiled languages are converted permanently into executable files before they are run. In contrast, scripting languages are typically converted into machine code on the fly during runtime by a program called an interpreter. Although this approach can cause performance problems because the instructions are not handled solely by the processor, it does make it easier for scripts to work with programs written in other languages"

CSS rules: presentation layer
HTML markup: content layer
JavaScript: presentation layer

Javascript: conforms to the ever-evolving ECMAScript standard
Browsers use ECMAScript to interpret JavaScript; so from your perspective, they
are effectively the same thing

We can use the latest JavaScript that conforms to ECMAScript 2015, but we use a
transpiler like Babel to work (translates into old JavaScript)

## JQuery
- Library of JavaScript functions
- Introduces CSS-like syntax and several visual and UI enhancements
- Simplifies the use of JavaScript in websites
- An abstraction of the core language

## JavaScript frameworks
AngularJS, React, Vue.js, and so on are front-end application frameworks used to
simplify the building of advanced interactive web-based applications.

## JavaScript platforms and runtime environments
Allow us to use JavaScript as a server side programming language

Example: Node.js > a JavaScript platform built on browser runtime environments.
Used to run advanced operations and applications on servers and computers using
JavaScript.
