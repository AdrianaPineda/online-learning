1. JavaScript is case sensitive
2. Use camelCase
- Variables start with lowercase letter "var greenDuck;"
- Objects and classes start with uppercase letter "var date = Date();"
- Constants are all-caps "const = CONSTANTLYUPPERCASE;"
3. Whitespace matters (to humans). JavaScript doesn't care about whitespaces, but humans do
4. End each statement with a semicolon. JavaScript doesn't care in general but is a good practice
5. Use comments liberally "//" or /*


a == b
a === b strict equality
